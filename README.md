# CodeFarm

CodeFarm is the prototype of a farming game which is on its way of becoming the GREATEST farming game ever !
The player personifies a farmer which needs to expand his farm by growing crops and selling goods. He will have to protect his farm against a mysterious alien invasion.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) as its game engine.

The game can be launched in dev mode with hot reloading by using :

```
npm run dev
```

Or create a build in the dist folder with :

```
npm run build
```

You can then launch the game by simply running an Express Http server :

```
npm run start
```
