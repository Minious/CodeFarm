# CodeFarm

CodeFarm is the prototype of a farming game which is on its way of becoming the GREATEST farming game ever !
The player personifies a farmer which needs to expand his farm by growing crops and selling goods. He will have to protect his farm against an mysterious alien invasion.

## Getting Started

Example with Python 3 :
```
cd CodeFarm

```
